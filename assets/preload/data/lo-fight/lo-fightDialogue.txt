:Shaya:embarrased: Come on B3, you didn’t dress up for the job? You at least could’ve worn some casual clothes.

:Shaya:embarrased: (B3, was that good bouncing?)
:B3:happy: (The best.)
:Shaya:veryhappy: Yay!

:B3:ready: Else you'll have rap battle with me for the backstage pass?
:Shaya:shocked: Really babe?! Didn't you just rap battle Pico?
:Whitty:confused: Wha- what?? Ugh... you know what fine. I’ll do your stupid rap battle.
:Whitty:hm: And I don’t have much time, so let’s do this quickly.
