:Whitty:carolcuff: We'll be taking this guy into custody. Thank the lord he's tired. Once we get to the station I'll contact T.A.N.K. to let em know we caught em.
:Whitty:carolcalm: Never would I have thought I'd see the infamous Whitty Whitmore burnt out, but here we are. Guess the Gunpowder twins aren't as invincible as we thought.
:Whitty:carol: I don't know how you two did it, but good job. Have a good night.
:B3:confused: Who the hell was that guy?
:autoskip:during: 5.5
:Shaya:embarrased: More importantly, I'm worried about T.A.N.K... What that bomb guy said might actually be true. I'll have to do some research about t-

:Julian:excited: Welcome to my secret hideout!
:Julian:excited: Oh yeah I should introduce myself!
:Julian:hm: I’m Julian!
:text:speed: 0.01
:Julian:excited: I’m Whitty’s little brother! I like games, I like music, I REALLY like painting! Especially on walls... I also like cats! They're so cute! And I listen to music a lot, I sing, although Whitty's doesn't like it, and when I'm really bored I just walk around the city. Although Whitty says not to do that since we're "criminals" but we're just trying to survive. I really hope he's alright. There's people who look for people like us sometimes and he says they make us look like the bad guys when we aren't and I think that's not cool. ALSO, since we don't have a house, I found this secret hideout so we could live here! Although it's not too secret anymore since you guys know about it...
